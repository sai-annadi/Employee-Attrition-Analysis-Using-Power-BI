### Overview
This Power BI project focuses on analyzing employee attrition data to gain insights into the factors influencing employee turnover. The dataset underwent thorough cleaning, ensuring accuracy and reliability in the analysis. By leveraging various visualization techniques, the project highlights key metrics and trends related to employee attrition, providing valuable insights for decision-making.

### Data Cleaning and Transformation
During the data transformation phase, several crucial steps were undertaken to prepare the data for analysis:

1.Null Value Removal: All records with missing values were removed to maintain data integrity.

2.Sorting: The data was arranged in ascending order to facilitate easier analysis.

3.Duplicate Removal: Duplicate values for the unique employee ID were eliminated to ensure each record represents a distinct employee.

4.Column Removal: The 'Years at Current Manager' column was removed as it was deemed irrelevant to the analysis.
Measures and Visualizations

#### In the Power BI visualization phase, two key measures were created:

1.Attrition Count: The total number of employees who left the organization.

2.Attrition Rate: The percentage of employees who left, calculated based on the attrition column.

#### The following visualizations were used to represent the data:

1.Cards: Displaying total employees, attrition count, attrition rate, average age of employees, average salary, and average years at the company.

2.Donut Chart: Showing attrition count by education field.

3.Clustered Column Chart: Illustrating attrition count by age group and by salary.

4.Table: Displaying job role and job satisfaction with attrition count as values.

5.Area Chart: Representing attrition count by years at the company, filtered for the top 15 years.

6.Clustered Bar Chart: Showing attrition count by job role, filtered for the top 5 job roles.

7.Clustered Column Chart: Highlighting attrition count by gender.

8.Line Chart: Depicting attrition rate by salary and gender.

This comprehensive analysis provides a detailed understanding of the factors affecting employee attrition, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions to improve employee retention and satisfaction.
